# 🏦 Power BI Banking Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project developed to analyze the core operations of a fictional banking institution. The dashboard provides in-depth insights into client distribution, loan performance, deposits, and overall engagement with the bank.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard for bank analysts and management that enables:
- Monitoring of key financial indicators
- Understanding client demographics and behavior
- Evaluating the performance of loans and deposits
- Filtering data by relevant banking parameters

In addition to Power BI, **Python** and **SQL** were used during the data preparation phase:
- **Python** was used for data cleaning, transformation, outlier removal, and creating initial exploratory visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **SQL** was used to extract relevant datasets from relational databases
